The two layers of the badge are held together with four plastic pegs, and pulling them apart uncovers a surprisingly barren interior. In fact the only component really worth mentioning is the Atmel ATSAMD21G16B, a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller. This 48 MHz chip includes 64 KB of flash, 8 KB of SRAM, a capacitive Peripheral Touch Controller (PTC), and an integrated USB controller.

The source of the summer signal has shifted from place to place.</br>

Some are left standing, others are lost to time.</br>

We won’t forget the ones we’ve lost.

each badge type has a number on it
Current theory is: arrange the name of the badges in the order of the phone number

While we've shared the signal from many spots,
there's one that stands above the rest.
It's a simple place without the slots,
some people still think it's the best

after translating text 

Those keycaps didn't appear out of nowhere. They grew layer by layer out of some very peculiarly named vats.

NamedAfter was title of page:
watching the making of defcon badge said they named the vats after the 7dwards then had to add 2
